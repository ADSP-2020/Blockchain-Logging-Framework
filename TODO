Extractor:
  ☐ Implement smart contract filter

Library:
  ☐ Add bit mapping
  ☐ Add value dictionary
  ☐ Add utility functionality for types
  ☐ Add null / empty constructor

Generator:
  ☐ Transformation for value dictionary
  ☐ Transformation for bit mapping

Writers:
  ☐ Check that if a new block is started and the block number is already known, data for this blocknumber will be overwritten.
  ☐ Set default folder and url

Configuration:
  ☐ Output folder config
  ☐ Client connections config

Open issues:
  ☐ currently array types are badly supported, e.g., for defining how to convert them into xes attributes
  ☐ add for loop for arrays
