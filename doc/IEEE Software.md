## Paper Content
- Focus on highlighting the potential of process mining for software engineering on the blockchain
- High level overview of BloXES framework (Details im BPM paper)
- Demonstrating benefits of process mining using 
    - New Angles for CryptoKitties
        - Process models centered on CryptoKitties vs centered on users (potentially demonstrating the need for manifests for different views)
        - Correlation of CryptoKitties value / dna and traces / auctions
        - Social networks / family trees for CryptoKitties
        - Social networks for users to detect power users, traders etc.
    - Augur (prediction market)
        - Conformance checking of models the whitepaper (https://www.augur.net/whitepaper.pdf)
        - Behavior analysis of users with regard to
            - Answering behavior 
            - Trading and disputing answers
    - secure https://secure.vote/
        - it's used productively by that company, or so they say, on both ETH and ETC (which might be a nice angle)
