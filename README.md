# Ethereum Logging Framework

This framework provides advanced logging capabilities for Ethereum applications on top of Web3J / Ethereum's JSON RPC. It consists of four components:

- Ethql: a query language for data on Ethereum
- Validator: a component to check ethql documents for specification erros
- Extractor: a component to extract, transform and format data based on ethql
- Generator: a component to create efficient logging functionality that can be embedded into smart contracts

Example ethql documents include 
- [AugurContractRegistry.ethql](./src/main/resources/AugurContractRegistry.ethql)
- [CryptoKitties.ethql](./src/main/resources/CryptoKitties.ethql)
- [GeneratorGitExample.ethql](./src/main/resources/GeneratorGitExample.ethql)
- [GeneratorGitExample.ethql](./src/main/resources/GeneratorShirtExample.ethql)
- [NetworkStatistics.ethql](./src/main/resources/NetworkStatistics.ethql)

Code demonstrating the use of the componentscan be found here
- [Validator](src/main/java/au/csiro/data61/aap/samples/ValidatorTest.java)
- [Extractor](src/main/java/au/csiro/data61/aap/samples/ExtractorTest.java)
- [Generator](src/main/java/au/csiro/data61/aap/samples/GeneratorTest.java)
